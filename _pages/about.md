I have been professionally writing code since 2019 (until then it was mostly academic) and while on my job, I have worked on writing scalable systems. I get to learn a lot of things, things that I feel like sharing, or at least storing them for my own references later. So expect posts related to software development, writing maintainable code, but also posts related to Data Science, Machine Learning as well.

## Tech you can talk to me about:

* Backend Development using **Flask**, **Node + Express**
* Making Databases using **MongoDB**, **MySQL**
* Frontend Development using **Bootstrap**, **React (with Flux/Redux)**
* Creating cloud applications using **Azure**
* Programming languages like **C++**, **C#**, **Python**, **JavaScript / TypeScript**
* **Machine Learning** and the Maths behind it

I like Machine Learning, and love understanding the why behind everything. To facilitate that, I often try to implement the common Machine Learning algorithms from scratch.
